Question 2

1. What happens when the number of hidden nodes increase?

When the number of hidden nodes increases from very small values (1–2) to moderate values (3–5), the model’s accuracy increases sharply. Beyond a certain point (around 5 hidden nodes), adding more hidden nodes does not significantly improve accuracy and may cause slight fluctuations.

2. Can you explain the pattern of the accuracy when the hidden nodes increase?

With very few hidden nodes, the network underfits because it cannot capture the complexity of the data, leading to low accuracy. As the hidden nodes increase, the network has more capacity to learn complex patterns, which improves accuracy. After reaching an optimal range of hidden nodes (around 3–5 for this dataset), the accuracy plateaus because the model already has enough capacity, and extra nodes bring little to no improvement.
